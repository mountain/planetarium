# planetarium

planetarium is a project try to solve the math problem beneath planet finding by deeplearning technologies.

problem
-------

In an assumed solar system, six planet are orbiting their sun.
But only four of them are observed, and we can get the position data.

![Observation of four planet][obsv]

From these observed position data, could we inference the orbit of the two hidden planet?
